# Mobile App Production Configuration

## Production Server Connection
Your mobile app is now configured to automatically connect to your production server for seamless updates.

### Configuration Details
- **Development:** Mobile app connects to `http://localhost:5000`
- **Production:** Mobile app connects to `https://besmi.replit.app`
- **Auto-switching:** Environment-based configuration handles this automatically

### Benefits
✅ **Instant Updates:** Any changes to your web platform appear immediately in mobile app
✅ **No App Store Resubmission:** Content and feature updates don't require new app store versions
✅ **Real-time Data:** Mobile app gets live appointment data, client updates, and payments
✅ **Single Codebase:** Maintain one platform that serves both web and mobile users

### Production Deployment Steps
1. **Deploy your web platform** to production (Replit autoscale deployment)
2. **Build mobile app** with production configuration:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npx cap sync
   ```
3. **Submit to app stores** once - future updates are automatic

### When App Store Updates ARE Required
- Native plugin changes (camera, notifications, etc.)
- App permissions modifications
- App icon or name changes
- Major version releases for marketing

### When App Store Updates are NOT Required
- New features on web platform
- UI/UX improvements
- Bug fixes
- Content updates
- Business logic changes
- API integrations

This gives you the flexibility to iterate quickly while maintaining native app presence in both stores.
