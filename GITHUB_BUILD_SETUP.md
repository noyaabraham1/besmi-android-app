# Build Android APK Through GitHub - No Android Studio Required

## Quick Setup Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Upload your Replit project to a GitHub repository
   - Create new repo on GitHub
   - Push your code: `git push origin main`

2. **Automatic Build**: GitHub Actions will automatically build your APK when you push code

3. **Download APK**: 
   - Go to your GitHub repo → Actions tab
   - Click the latest build
   - Download "besmi-android-apk" artifact
   - Extract to get your APK file

## What Happens Automatically
- ✅ Installs Android SDK and build tools
- ✅ Installs Node.js dependencies  
- ✅ Builds your web assets
- ✅ Syncs Capacitor with Android
- ✅ Compiles Android APK
- ✅ Makes APK available for download

## Alternative: EAS Build (Even Easier)
If you prefer, you can also use Expo's EAS Build service:

```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli
npx create-expo-app --template blank-typescript
eas build --platform android --local
```

The GitHub Actions approach is completely free and doesn't require any local Android setup. Your APK will be ready for testing on devices or uploading to Google Play Store.
